# GlobalFoundries Internship Project

Given a new IT ticket issue, find if any similar solutions exist in the record history. I find which is the closest possible match for any new issue.I have used Natural Language Processing by representing the "Issue text" as BOW (Bag Of Words). To calculate similarity between IT tickets i have used a modified version of TF-IDF.
